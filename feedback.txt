Homework 1

The maximum grade for this homework is 8%. Points are subtracted from this maximum grade: for example, saying
that 2% is lost if some requirement is not completed means that the resulting grade will be 8%-2% => 6%;
if the core homework functionality does not work or it is not implemented as specified in your documentation,
 your grade will be zero;

Grading Criteria:
 - only some basic cloud simulation examples from the cloudsim repo are given and nothing else is done:
    * slightly more complex than basic examples: -0.3%
 - having less than five unit and/or integration scalatests:
    * 5+ tests, 1 in java failed to compile: -1%
 - missing comments and explanations from the simulation program:
    * minimal amounts of comments: -0.2%
 - logging is not used in the simulation programs:
    * logging used: -0%
 - hardcoding the input values in the source code instead of using the suggested configuration libraries:
    * config used
 - for each used var for heap-based shared variables or mutable collections:
    * none used: -0%
 - for each used while or for or other loops with induction variables to iterate over a collection:
    * none used: -0%
 - no instructions in README.md on how to install and run your simulator:
    * instructions present: 0%
 - the program crashes without completing the core functionality:
    * program runs but terminates with runtime exception: -4%
 - the documentation exists but it is insufficient to understand your cloud simulation design and models and how you assembled and deployed all components of the cloud:
    * documentation present: -0%
Total grade: 2.5%
Comments: I couldn't compile the java test cases, let me know if it's supposed to compile. And during runtime, there was
an exception:
