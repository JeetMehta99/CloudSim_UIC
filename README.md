# Project: Cloud Simulation using CloudSim-Plus
## Overview
### The project is of the course 441 - Engineering Distributed Objects for Cloud Computing at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
# NAME: MEHTA JEET
# UIN= 668581235
### Cloud computing is on the forefront in terms of reliability, security, fault-tolerance, sustainability, and scalability in computational services.
### Different simulations with different parameters have been explored using time-shared policy and space share-shared policy.
### I used the scala and Java language for this project and the project is built in SBT.

## Prerequisite:
### SBT installed on the system.
# Instructions:
### 1. Running project using SBT
### 2. Clone the repository.
### 3. Open IntelliJ IDEA with scala Plugin.
### 4. Open and extract the project.
### 5. Build the project from the option at the top.
### 6. Run the execSimulation 
### 7. Go to terminal of IntelliJ :(process can be done in cmd of Windows too)
